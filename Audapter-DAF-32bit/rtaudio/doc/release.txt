RtAudio - a set of C++ classes which provide a common API for realtime audio input/output across Linux (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), SGI, Macintosh OS X (CoreAudio), and Windows (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems.

By Gary P. Scavone, 2001-2005.

v3.0.2: (14 October 2005)
- modification of ALSA read/write order to fix duplex under/overruns
- added synchronization of input/output devices for ALSA duplex operation
- cleaned up and improved error reporting throughout
- bug fix in Windows DirectSound support for 8-bit audio
- bug fix in Windows DirectSound support during device capture query
- added ASIOOutputReady() call near end of callbackEvent to fix some driver behavior
- added #include <stdio.h> to RtAudio.cpp
- fixed bug in RtApiCore for duplex operation with different I/O devices
- improvements to DirectX pointer chasing (by Robin Davies)
- backdoor RtDsStatistics hook provides DirectX performance information (by Robin Davies)

- adopted MIT-like license
- various internal structural changes and bug fixes

v2.01: (27 April 2002)
